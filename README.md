# Cocossharp

Game examples developed in Xamarin using Cocossharp.

Yes, another flappy bird clone, I know. But the important thing is that I learned a lot of things making this little game in Xamarin-Cocossharp. It is hard to find tutorials, code examples for Cocossharp, so I wanted to share this project and hopefully few more in the future.

I have been working several years as software developer mainly focused on Windows desktop bussiness applications using technologies like Windows Forms, WPF, Silverlight.

I always have wanted to learn games development and I started studing few tutorials and books of iOS spritekit which is wonderful, but with the disadvantage that is only for apple devices besides learning a new programming language, Swift. I also gave a shot to Unity and completed few tutorials.

When Microsoft acquired Xamarin and it became free, I started to learn Xamarin to develop mobile applications and I saw Cocossharp I thought would be interesting to try out. I don't know much about games engines yet, but I was able to port few examples from spritekit (Swift) to Cocossharp very quicky and easy.

This flappy bird clone was completed in 1 day based and porting some part of the code from spritekit swift tutorials from https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/36/0/introduction, and adapting part of the custom physics from https://www.raywenderlich.com/62049/sprite-kit-tutorial-make-platform-game-like-super-mario-brothers-part-1 (objective-c) and my own code to make it work. Also, the graphics are from https://kenney.itch.io/ where I purchased great graphics for very low price. Thanks Kenney.

The code is very simple and it shows how to do few common task like the following:

Parallax scrolling using actions.
Custom physics.
Animations.
Using sound effects and background music.
Scene transitions
Created using Visual Studio 2015, Xamarin Cocossharp Forms 1.7.1. I tested the Android and iOS projects and both worked very well in simulators and real devices.
